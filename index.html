            <p>....But for now, some quotes from my favorite movies!</p>
            <br>
            <p>The unlucky are nothing more than a frame of reference for the lucky. You are unlucky, so I may know that I am not. 
                Unfortunately the lucky never realizes they are lucky until it's too late. 
                Take yourself for instance; yesterday you were better off than you are off today but it took today for you to realize it. 
                But today has arrived and it's too late. 
                You see? People are never happy with what they have. They want what they had, or what someone else has.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The first time someone calls you a horse you punch him on the nose, the second time someone calls you a horse you call him a jerk but the third time someone calls you a horse, well then perhaps it's time to go shopping for a saddle.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright. 
                He'd be damned if any slopes gonna put their greasy yellow hands on his boy's birthright, so he hid it, in the one place he knew he could hide something: his ass. 
                Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. 
                I hid this uncomfortable piece of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. 
                And now, little man, I give the watch to you.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. 
                God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables - slaves with white collars. 
                Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. 
                We're the middle children of history, man. 
                No purpose or place. 
                We have no Great War. 
                No Great Depression. 
                Our great war is a spiritual war... Our great depression is our lives. 
                We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won't. 
                We're slowly learning that fact. 
                And we're very, very pissed off.
